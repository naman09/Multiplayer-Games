# Project Overview

The aim of the project is to show working of a client server application with the help of socket programming. Best application to show this is through a massive multiplayer online game which has hundreds of clients interacting simultaneously with the server.

For this project, we have created a server which accepts up to 100 requests from clients connected in a local area network. In this way any computer which has the server- side code can act as a server by sharing it's private IP address and then every player can connect to it.
